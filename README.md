# Magnific-Evals

A python package for testing LLMs specifically for voice agents under customer service scenarios.

## Installation

```bash
pip install magnific-llm-evals
```

This will automatically install all required dependencies.

Alternatively, if installing from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/austinw1995/magnific-llm-evals
cd magnific-llm-evals
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- Evaluate multiple LLMs against various customer conversation scenarios by customizing the service and customer agents
- Define custom evaluation criteria for a successful conversation
- Run multiple tests in parallel and record conversation transcripts
- Generate detailed evaluation reports

## Usage

First, set up your API keys depending on what LLMs you want to test.
```
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["TOGETHER_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["XAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"] = "..."
```

We support a variety of LLMs through 7 providers, which are OpenAI, Anthropic, TogetherAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Cerebrad, XAI, and Google Gemini:
You can access different models through different providers with
```
from magnific import (
    OpenAIProvider,
    AnthropicProvider,
    TogetherAIProvider,
    GroqProvider,
    DeepSeekProvider,
    CerebrasProvider,
    XAIProvider,
    GeminiProvider,
)
```
For each provider, the following models are supported:

To set the configuration for a service or customer agent, create a LLMConfig object with the desired parameters.
1. params is a dictionary of any parameter supported by the LLM model provider.
2. system_prompt is the instruction task for the LLM agent to follow.
3. end_call_enabled is a boolean that determines if the LLM should be able to end the call with the function call end_call(). (Note: IMPORTANT texts are highlighted in the system prompt to ensure function call reliability).

```
service_config_1 = LLMConfig(
        params={
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "max_tokens": 150,
        },
        system_prompt="""You are a voice assistant for Vappy's Pizzeria, a pizza shop located on the Internet...IMPORTANT: Do not use tool end_call() until all of the customer's questions are answered and they say something like "bye" or "see you.''
""",
        end_call_enabled=True
    )

service_config_2 = LLMConfig(
        params={
            "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
            "temperature": 0.2,
            "max_tokens": 90,
        },
        system_prompt="""You are a voice assistant for Vappy's Burgers, a burger shop located on the Internet...IMPORTANT: Do not use tool end_call() until all of the customer's questions are answered and they say something like "bye" or "see you.'
""",
        end_call_enabled=True
    )

customer_config_1 = LLMConfig(
        params={
            "model": "gemini-2.0-flash"
        },
        system_prompt="""You are a hungry customer who wants to order food...IMPORTANT: Use the tool end_call() only when you are satisfied with your order and all your questions are answered.
""",
        end_call_enabled=True
    )

customer_config_2 = LLMConfig(
        params={
            "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
            "temperature": 0.9,
            "max_tokens": 50,
        },
        system_prompt="""You are a cheerful customer who wants to order food...IMPORTANT: Use the tool end_call() only when you are satisfied with your order and all your questions are answered.
""",
        end_call_enabled=True
    )
```

To instantiate a list of conversations for testing, use the LLMConversation class.
1. type is the type of conversation, either "inbound" or "outbound", inbound is the customer calling in and outbound is the service agent calling out.
2. first_message is the first message in the conversation by the caller.
3. evaluations is a list of user defined evaluations to be performed on the conversation, customize the name of the evaluation and prompt, which specifies the evaluation criteria.

```
conversations = [
        LLMConversation(
            service_provider=OpenAIProvider(config=service_config_1),
            customer_provider=GeminiProvider(config=customer_config_1),
            type="inbound",
            first_message="Hi, what's on the menu today?",
            evaluations=[
                Evaluation(name="Menu", prompt="The menu should be displayed in a structured format, with each item on a new line."),
                Evaluation(name="helpfulness", prompt="The service agent should be helpful and answer all questions.")
            ]
        ),
        LLMConversation(
            service_provider=AnthropicProvider(config=service_config_2),
            customer_provider=GroqProvider(config=customer_config_2),
            type="outbound",
            first_message="Hi, what would you like to order?",
            evaluations=[
                Evaluation(name="Menu", prompt="The menu should be displayed in a structured format, with each item on a new line."),
                Evaluation(name="conciseness", prompt="The service agent should be concise.")
            ]
        ),
        LLMConversation(
            service_provider=OpenAIProvider(config=service_config_1),
            customer_provider=GeminiProvider(config=customer_config_1),
            type="inbound",
            first_message="Hi, I'm so hungry",
            evaluations=[
                Evaluation(name="empathy", prompt="The service agent should be empathetic and show understanding of the customer's situation."),
                Evaluation(name="frustration", prompt="The customer should not be frustrated or annoyed.")
            ]
        )
    ]
```

Finally, to run the tests in parallel, with the evaluation criterias (for eval models we only support openai for now), use the TestRunner class.

```
runner = TestRunner(eval_model="gpt-4o-mini")
results = await runner.run_tests(conversations)
```

The results will be a dictionary with the test_id as the key and the result as the value.
An example result based on the conversations above is shown below, where the evaluations output scores and reasons for passing or failing. The LLM configurations of service and customer agents are also included in the result for prompt management purposes.
